  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>"I've traveled the world and faced numerous struggles along the way, but I've learned from each experience.
    Despite losing dreams and encountering obstacles, I've remained resilient, growing through empathy and determination.
    My travels to the USA, UK, Australia, and the Caribbean have enriched my life by exposing me to diverse cultures.
    I am grateful for the support of those close to me, which has enabled me to thrive.
    My goal is to inspire and uplift others, giving them the strength to chase their own aspirations."
